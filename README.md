On our Saturday mornings we can't cover all there is to know about Java, but you don't have to know everything to make a start.  There are lots of books and websites on learning Java, some particularly for beginners, and they are certainly worth looking at.  But the best way to learn any programming language is just to program in it, so fire up your Eclipse and give it a go.
