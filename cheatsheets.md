## Java bits

### programs

`TellJoke` is a simple Java program.  All Java code lives in a [`class`](#classes). 
A Java program has a starting point which is a [method](#methods) called `main`.


```java
package com.coderdojobelfast.jokebot;

/**
 * This is a comment.  It doesn't do anything, but it's useful for describing what the code does.
 */
public class TellJoke {

	public static void main(String [] args) {
		System.out.println("What do you call a sleeping bull?  A bulldozer!");
	}
}
```
