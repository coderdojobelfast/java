# Mentors' notes

## Jokebot

Jokebot is code for the first session, to get familiar with Eclipse and learn some basic Java by writing a joke-telling robot.

Run through examples in order:

### TellJoke

Introduce simple Java 'hello world' style program - skip over structure for now and describe how to produce output.

### AskJoke

Add concepts of input, variables, `if` statement.

### KnockKnock

Dive into OO concepts a bit more deeply.  Introduce `class` and object concepts, member variables, methods.

Why bother with classes?  Explain usefulness for code re-use, illustrate with main.

### JokeBot

Finally we can write our joke-telling robot, re-using the knock-knock code. Lists, `for` loops.  Make a note of the encapsulation of the joke code, the JokeBot code doesn't know how the joke works and doesn't care.
